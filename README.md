create a simplified Arabic text to be processed 
Hi.

If we have  "اللـــُغةُ الـعَـــــربية" as a model answer and 5 people to answer the question of "أجمل لغات العالم" . we would have 5 correct answers written in different ways for the same word

1- " اللعة العربية"

2-" اللٌغة العــــــربية"

3-"اللغة العربية" etc

simple codes can classify "Englesh Longuage" as "English language" whatever it became more harder in arabic, with the Huge number of words, different kind of writing styles, also the hard grammatical issues in Arabic.

here I toke an initial step with create a simplified Arabic text can be processed easily. With "==" compare I got 100% accuracy in simple text 1-3 words.

whatever I will not use "==" relation to check similarity of text  but I will use simplified text.



kindly check my notebook and leave a review.
